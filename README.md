## üîç Overview
Transform raw Adidas sales data into actionable business intelligence by:
- Cleaning and standardizing data in Excel using Power Query

- Calculating KPIs (e.g., total revenue, units sold, sales growth) with DAX formulas

## üîÑ Workflow
1. Import raw sales data into Excel
2. Clean and transform data using Power Query
3. Export the cleaned data to Power BI
4. Build interactive dashboards‚Äîfilters, drill-throughs, time-series analysis
5. Create DAX measures for dynamic KPIs and trends
6. Generate insights into sales, regional, and product performance

Check the `dashboards/` folder for `.pbix` files or screenshots.

## üìä DAX Formulas
Sample DAX measures used in Power BI:

```dax
Total Sales = SUM('Sales'[Revenue])
Units Sold = SUM('Sales'[Units Sold])
Average Sales = AVERAGE('Sales'[Revenue])
Yearly Sales Growth = CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATESYTD('Sales'[Date]))
Top Product = CALCULATE(
    MAX('Sales'[Product]),
    FILTER('Sales', 'Sales'[Revenue] = [Total Sales])
)
```
Find additional measures and dynamic KPIs in the `dax/` folder.
