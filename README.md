Sample DAX measures used in Power BI:

```dax
Total Customers = COUNTROWS(telecom_combined)
Average MonthlyCharges = AVERAGE(telecom_combined[MonthlyCharges])
Churned customers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(telecom_combined),telecom_combined[Churn]="Yes")
Churned Rate = DIVIDE([Churned customers],[Total Customers])
)
```
